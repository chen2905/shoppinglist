/*
A store is basically just a plain JavaScript object that allows components to share state. 
In a way, we can think of a store as a database. On the most fundamental level, both constructs 
allow us to store data in some form or another.
It's simple to get access to the store inside a React component â€“ no need to pass the store as a prop or import it,
 just use the connect function from React Redux, and supply a mapStateToProps function that pulls out the data you need. 
 Then, inside the component, you can pass that data to a function that needs it.
